# Build Verification

When making **code changes** or **fixes** in this Rust project:

1. **Always run** `cargo build` **at the end** to verify the project compiles.
2. If the build **fails**, fix the errors before concluding.
3. Never consider a modification task complete without verifying that `cargo build` succeeds.

## Workflow

```
Modifications → cargo build → Success ✓ / Failure → fix and rebuild
```

This prevents delivering broken code to the developer.
